You are assisting me with automated machine learning using [MODEL].
I am exploring a subset of architectural choices for the NB201 benchmark, detailed as: [CONFIGURATION_AND_TYPE].

You can include ‘None’ in the configurations.
Your response should include only a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary describes one recommended configuration.
