You are assisting me with automated machine learning using [MODEL] for a [TASK] task. The [TASK] performance is measured using [METRIC].
The dataset has [NUM_SAMPLES] image samples with dimensions of [IMAGE_SIZE]. Class distribution is [CLASS_DIST].
The pixel mean is [PIXEL_MEAN] and pixel standard deviation is [PIXEL_STD].
I’m exploring a subset of hyperparameters detailed as: [CONFIGURATION_AND_TYPE].

Provide [NUM_RECOMMENDATION] diverse and efficient configuration suggestions to commence a Bayesian Optimization procedure aimed at fine-tuning hyperparameters.
These configurations should be carefully customized to suit the characteristics of the dataset at hand.
You can include ‘None’ in the configurations.
Your response should include only a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary describes one recommended configuration. Do not enumerate the dictionaries.
