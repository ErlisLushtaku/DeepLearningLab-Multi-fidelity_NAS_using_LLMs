You are assisting me with automated machine learning using [MODEL] for a [TASK] task. The [TASK] performance is measured using [METRIC].
The dataset has [NUM_SAMPLES] image samples with dimensions of [IMAGE_SIZE]. Class distribution is [CLASS_DIST].
The pixel mean is [PIXEL_MEAN] and pixel standard deviation is [PIXEL_STD].
I’m exploring a subset of hyperparameters detailed as: [CONFIGURATION_AND_TYPE].

Provide [NUM_RECOMMENDATION] diverse and efficient configuration suggestions to commence a Bayesian Optimization procedure aimed at fine-tuning hyperparameters.
These configurations should be carefully customized to suit the characteristics of the dataset at hand.
You can include ‘None’ in the configurations.
Your response should include only a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary describes one recommended configuration. Do not enumerate the dictionaries.
The list of dictionaries should be wrapped with square brackets [], and each dictionary should be wrapped with curly brackets {}.
Here is an example of the response format:
```
[
    {
        "op_0_to_1": "none",
        "op_0_to_2": "avg_pool_3x3",
        "op_0_to_3": "none",
        "op_1_to_2": "skip_connect",
        "op_1_to_3": "nor_conv_3x3",
        "op_2_to_3": "nor_conv_1x1"
    },
    {
        "op_0_to_1": "avg_pool_3x3",
        "op_0_to_2": "avg_pool_3x3",
        "op_0_to_3": "none",
        "op_1_to_2": "skip_connect",
        "op_1_to_3": "nor_conv_3x3",
        "op_2_to_3": "nor_conv_1x1"
    },
]
```
